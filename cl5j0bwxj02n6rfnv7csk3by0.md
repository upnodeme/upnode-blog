## The Best Meson Network node Hosting Providers 2022

The following are the VPS resources that I found that are more suitable for deploying Meson nodes. Since Meson mainly measures bandwidth, IP, and stability, I distinguish it by the size of the bandwidth. It is strongly recommended to buy a machine with a G port. Specific mining rules can be found in the official Meson documentation.
